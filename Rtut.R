#----- VARIABLES ----
# Variable names in R start with letters, thereafter they can contain other letter, numbers, underscores or dots
# Most languages use data types to define how much space to set asside in memory.
# Variables in R are assigned R Objects

# Types are dynamic which means a variable'S data type changes based on the data assigned to it.

#Types in R.
#class gets the data type and print displays it to the console.
#numeric
print(class(4))

# integer
print(class(4L))
# Why is "L" used as a suffix?
# Could be: 
# Because R handles complex numbers which may be specified using the suffix "i" and this would be too simillar to "I"
# Because R's integers are 32-bit long integers and "L" therefore appears to be sensible shorthand for referring to this data type.
# The value a long integer can take depends on the word size. R does not natively support integers with a word length of 64-bits. 
#Integers in R have a word length of 32 bits and are signed and therefore have a range of âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Larger values are stored as double.
